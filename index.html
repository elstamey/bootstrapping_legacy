              content="Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to support an application built on an older framework. Upgrading isn't an option. The code is untested and nowhere near best practices or standards. In this session we'll talk about strategies to incorporate modern PHP coding practices to add features and functionality and retiring the older code in pieces. We'll review specific examples and code from a real project where we bootstrapped an early CodeIgniter app.">

                        I began using PHP in 1999.  But most of the web applications I have worked on have
                        involved starting with someone else's work

                        My group in the College of Engineering manages a  pile of PHP applications.  Many of these were student-built and are useful to the person or people they were buit for, however they have only been worked on when they have a problem or a new need.

                        So now we have a pile of legacy that we must support.

					<h3>Supporting Legacy is Hard</h3>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <blockquote class="style4">
                        It&#39;s harder to read code than to write it. This is why code reuse is so hard.

                    <aside class="notes">
                        Starting with someone else's code is challenging.  Our tendency as developers is to replace it with a more familiar code, our own.

                        But many these legacy applications have grown beyond simple CRUD applications and now have a lot of business logic baked in.

                        It is important that we develop the skills to begin with someone else's code and fix only what is needed.

					<h3>Why Bootstrapping is important</h3>
					<ul>
						<li><p>A lot of web development work involves supporting <strong>legacy</strong> applications</p>
						</li>
						<li><p>It is HARD to justify <strong>refactoring</strong>  </p>
						</li>
						<li><p><strong>Bootstrapping</strong> gives you flexibility to support your application</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>Let&#39;s review some terminology... (source: wikipedia)</strong></p>
                    <aside class="notes">
                        A lot of our work involves supporting legacy applications.  We can't convince managers to let us
                        refactor the code when it isn't broken.  Learning to bootstrap the legacy codebase gives you options
                        beyond replacing the entire application using the latest strategies.

                        But before we begin, let's review some of these terms and make sure we're on the same page.
                    </aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Legacy Software</h3>
					<p>Software developed using older technologies and practices.  It can be difficult to replace because of its wide use.</p>
					<p>Often a pejorative term, referencing a system as &quot;legacy&quot; often implies that the system is out of date or in need of replacement.</p>
                    <aside class="notes">
                        A legacy application was usually developed using older strategies.  In the PHP world, this runs the gamut between
                        code that uses includes for functionality and styling of the page; and go all the way to modern frameworks that were
                        poorly implemented.
                    </aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Spaghetti Code</h3>
					<p>The relationships between pieces of code are so tangled, it’s nearly impossible to add or change something without unpredictably breaking something.</p>
                    <aside class="notes">
                        Spaghetti code is what you would call the older functional PHP programming because the page styling and
                        functionality are intermingled.  This also applies to code that doesn't meet the Single Responsibility principle.
                    </aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Lasagna code</h3>
					<p>Lasagna code is code that has way too many layers.  </p>
					<p>In Object Oriented programming, this means code that has many really small classes when a few slightly larger classes would have done the trick.</p>
                    <aside class="notes">
                        I truly believe Lasagna Code was a term made to perpetuate the pasta metaphor, but it generally applies
                        to unbalanced code with classes that are either too large or too small.
                        A good lasagna has balanced layers.
                    </aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Refactor</h3>
					<p>Technique for restructuring an existing body of code, altering its internal structure <strong>without changing its external behavior</strong>.</p>
                    <aside class="notes">
                        Refactoring is a term often misused.  It means that you are changing the code without altering the aplication's behavior.
                        You can make your application more secure, improve a Database query, things like that without altering what the user sees
                        and does in the application.
                        Once you change behavior, you're no longer refactoring.  This is why managers don't really support
                        refactoring.  There is not a visible gain FOR THEM or the user.  Charts and benchmarking may help this cause.
                    </aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Technical Debt</h3>
					<p>A metaphor referring to the eventual consequences of any system design, software architecture or software development within a codebase.</p>
                    <aside class="notes">
                        When we develop many simple task apps in our group, we are building technical debt.  We know that these tools
                        are useful to someone and we know we're choosing to ignore them for long periods of time because they aren't a squeaky wheel.
                        There is an instant gratification about building a tool that helps someone do their job well.  That our dept can't get enough of.
                        But the developers know it will inevitably bite us.  That simple CRUD app that one person uses will one day break and be an urgen fix.
                        The student who built it won't be here anymore.  These are our adventures!
                        Unfortunately, this technical debt isn't purely on simple CRUD apps.  We have many larger applications, as well.  And those were student-built but have
                        grown too large to be student-maintained.  And the users are too high on the org chart to let them die.
                    </aside>

				<section>
					<h3>Bootstrapping</h3>
					<p>In software this usually means, <strong>building onto an existing system</strong> for the purpose of improvement with the least amount of sweat equity and development cost in the process.</p>
                    <aside class="notes">
                        Bootstrapping is a combination of refactoring and new features; it allows you to modernize your legacy application
                        without necessarily replacing the whole thing.

					<h1 style="color: #fafafa;">The Project: Scholarships</h1>
                    <aside class="notes">
                        I'm going to be telling you about a project I worked on for the College of Engineering
                        It is a scholarships tool.  And when I was given this app to support three years ago, all code was changed in production.
                        The application was in use for most of the Academic year, so that meant I would have about a month at the end of the summer to
                        "FIX THE CODE", test it, and have it ready for the next Academic year.  This month was a gift, they really
                        wanted me to do it in two weeks.

                        The application was an early version of Code Igniter.  But that fact really doesn't mean much.
                        It was an MVC application implemented by a student who didn't really understand how to organize their code in MVC.
                    </aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>The Project: Scholarships</h3>
					<ul>
						<li><p>Engineering <strong>Foundation</strong> receives money from donors to give to <strong>students</strong></p>
						</li>
						<li><p><strong>Students</strong> apply each year giving information about themselves</p>
						</li>
						<li><p><strong>Donors</strong> specify criteria/rules for students to receive money</p>
						</li>
						<li><p><strong>Selection Committee</strong> selects Candidates to receive money</p>
						</li>
						<li><p><strong>Scholarship Coordinator</strong> reports these Recipients to Financial Aid</p>
						</li>
						<li><p><strong>Financial Aid</strong> awards the money</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
                    <aside class="notes">
                        I want to tell you a bit about how Scholarships work.  In the Fall, students began applying for the NEXT academic year.
                        In their application, students tell us things about themselves in order to be a better match for the aide

                        Donors tell the College who they want to receive the money, based on majors, gpa, and sometimes clubs

                        In the Spring, the selection committee finds out how much money there is to be given and they choose matching candidates to receive money.

                        A Scholarship Coordinator sends those candidates, the amount of money, and the term to Financial Aid to be given the following Fall and/or Spring.

                        Someone was using this tool at all times during the year.  This made a tight support window.
                        It really needed to have the functionality separated into Bounded Contexts, so that the student application could be worksed on
                        when they weren't actively applying.
                        The problem was that almost all of the functionality was in one App model.  It was not seperated by
                        Students, Foundation, or Selection

                        The code was spaghetti

                        We're going to talk about how my team bootstrapped this application by leaving the existing app in place and functioning
                        but adding new code in adjacent space and tying it into the CodeIgniter app
                    </aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>How to Bootstrap</h3>
					<ol>
						<li><p>Survey Your Application</p>
							<p> Legacy projects have business value baked in, that you must preserve.</p>
						</li>
						<li><p>Organize the Work to be done</p>
							<p> Based on the bugs, new features, etc.  You have to balance needs vs. wants to deliver this product.</p>
						</li>
					</ol>
                    <aside class="notes">
                        In order to bootstrap an application like this, you have to be well organized.  You need to complete a full survery of users and functionality
                        And then you have to plan the work that's most necessary.
                    </aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Survey Your Application</h3>
					<ol>
						<li><p>Talk to users of the application </p>
						</li>
						<li><p>Study the codebase</p>
						</li>
						<li><p>Examine the new feature requests</p>
						</li>
					</ol>
                    <aside class="notes">
                        For your survey, you want to talk to the users, study the code, and since there are always new features, you want to
                        see how those might fit in.  I recommend talking to the users first, because you will need to
                        look at the code again after you talk to them.
                    </aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Talk to Users of the Application</h3>
					<ol>
						<li><p>Is their process consistent with the application?  </p>
						</li>
						<li><p>What are the pain points?</p>
						</li>
						<li><p>Do they have concerns with the application?</p>
						</li>
					</ol>
					<p><strong>Don’t rely on developer feedback</strong></p>
                    <aside class="notes">
                        Talking to the previous developer does NOT count as talking to your users.
                        When you speak to the users of your application, you want to know about their process, and
                        does it match what they are doing in the application.
                        Identify any pain points they have in using the applciation
                        Finally, do they have concerns?  Do they trust it?  Hate it?
                        This is all necessary feedback.
                        Listening to your users here allows you to deliver REAL value, so pay attention!

					<h3>User Feedback: Scholarship Process</h3>
					<p><strong>Process was inconsistent with the application</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li><p>Selection Committee used a spreadsheet of available scholarship money </p>
						</li>
						<li><p>Selected Candidates were added to a spreadsheet Student ID and Amount and Term of award</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
                    <aside class="notes">
                        We found that the application was inconsistent with their process
                        The existing scholarship application gave matching students a score on the Scholarship page.  But there
                        was no way to select that student for an award.  The Selection Committee received a spreadsheet
                        that said which scholarships had money, and how much was available to be awarded.
                        They used our tool to review the matching applicants and make their selections by
                        building a spreadsheet of the scholarship account number, student id number, amount and term they should receive the money.

					<h3>User Feedback: Scholarship Pain Points</h3>
					<p><strong>High Margin of Error</strong>  </p>
					<p>Their process was exiting and re-entering the system through spreadsheets</p>
                    <aside class="notes">
                        So they were in and out of the tool with spreadsheets filling the gaps.
                        This had a high margin of error.  Manual entry of numbers.
                        It was tedious and painful
                    </aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>User Feedback: Scholarship Concerns</h3>
					<ul>
						<li><p>They didn’t trust that Selection Committee was choosing the best candidates</p>
						</li>
						<li><p>The Scoring algorithm was not clear/effective</p>
						</li>
						<li><p>Multiple majors weren&#39;t allowed by our system</p>
						</li>
						<li><p><strong>NOT ALL MONEY WAS BEING AWARDED</strong></p>
						</li>
						<li><p><strong>MONEY LEFT UN-GIVEN ⇒ ANGRY DONORS</strong></p>
						</li>
					</ul>
                    <aside class="notes">
                        We also learned they didn't trust the application or that selection committee was choosing valid applicants
                        A student could be rejected by Financial Aid for lack of enrollment, not being in COE, low GPA etc.
                        The application wasn't able to predict those changes.  So when FA rejected an award, it created mistrust.
                        And there was no guarantee that a student matched the criteria a donor specified.  But that information can change
                        each semester.

                        Our scoring algorithm had a problem.  Early on, they had decided they didn't want to exclude applicants, even if they didn't match required criteria.
                        But this meant that a student who matched 2 required and 1 optional criteria, had the same score as match against 3 required criteria.
                        A selection committee member had to scrutinize the candidates or choose a bad match.

                        Our application didn't allow for multiple majors, and this was becomming an issue because their non-engineering major was
                        often the major our application saw and made it difficult for them to match for engineering scholarships.

                        One of the biggest complications and a driving force for a project this large being moved to the top of the queue
                        was that there had been a lot of money either unarwarded or rejected, which made many donors angry.
                        The Dean got involved, and everyone understood the priority.

                        Because of this, we decided we needed to improve the accuracy of our selections and reduce the number of rejected awards.

                        We would develop new features adjacent to the framework and connect that into the framework's routing layer
                        We wanted to replace the application in pieces, but we didn't want to get stuck rebuilding all of the crud components.

                        to sure up our development process.

                        First of all, we were developing in production!

                    <aside class="notes">
                        We needed to get the codebase into version control, first.  Our department had just bought Github Enterprise,
                        so the only hurdle we had to overcome was finding all of the PII data that was hidden in small scripts and the code itself.

                        Next, we needed develpment environments that closely matched our production web servers.  Staging space
                        was a fairly easy problem to resolve, we just created another vhost on the server.  But the devlopment environment
                        required a vagrant box and puppet configuration, which one of my coworkers was able to put together and refine

                        This allowed us to develop changes and have fewer deployment issues than when we were developing using MAMP.

                        We were building alongside an existing, untesting application.  There were no "units", individual classeses
                        with behavior that we could test. But there was functionality we were expecting to keep working while we implemented
                        new features and restructured how Selection would work.

                        Testing was critical in this process!  We began with a set of Acceptance tests that would allow us to verify that
                        the data displayed on the student application page remained unchanged.  We changed the usability and user interface of the
                        application with minor tweaks around what was considered a complete application and questions asked
                        by some departments in the COE.

                        The new code we built had units, so We build unit and functional tests of those features using PHPUnit, which was incredibly powerful
                        working as a team.  We could ensure that we didn't break each other's code if we continued running the full suite of tests before merging our pull requests.

                        also be made across the team, and in staging or production environments.  And if something unexpected happened, it could be undone.
                        It basically allowed us to version control DB changes.  And although it isn't recommended, we did have to use it extensively for data migrations in
                        addition to schema changes.

                        I've included two examples of a Phinx migration:

                        One is the change migration, which is a single function, and Phinx is supposed to know how to undo that change, so you don't have to write a down migration.
                        However, we had many changes that the change() method wasn't as reliable for us.

                        Example #2 is the type of migration we generally write.  This example renames a DB column from bio to biography.
                        The down() method undoes this change, renaming the column bio again.  There would probably be a code change to queries of the 'bio' data, and we would submit
                        those changes together with the migration, so the code was not in a broken state.
